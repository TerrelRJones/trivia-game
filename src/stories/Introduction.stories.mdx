# Hello and welcome to Storybook!

Storybook helps you build UI components in isolation from your app's business logic, data, and context.
That makes it easy to develop hard-to-reach states. Save these UI states as **stories** to revisit during development, testing, or QA.

There's a stories directory under `src/stories/` for general purpose pages (like this one!) as well as for global styles.
Otherwise you can save component-specific stories in the same directory as the component, just make sure to use the `[component].stories.tsx` naming convention.

We also highly encourage you to check out the [Introduction to Storybook for React](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/introduction) for some great resources on all the great
features Storybook provides.
